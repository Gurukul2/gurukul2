# Break Statement:
# We can use break statement inside loops to break loop execution based on some condition.
# for i in range(10):
#     if i == 7:
#         print("processing is enough..plz break")
#         break
#     print(i)


# Continue Statement:
# We can use continue statement to skip current iteration and continue next iteration.
# for i in range(10):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         continue
#         print(i)

# Pass Statement:
# pass is a keyword in Python.
# In our programming syntactically if block is required which won't do anything then we can define that empty block with pass keyword.
# def m1():
#     pass



# 1. Write a program to display numbers from 1 to 10 in descending order.
# for x in range(10, 0, -1):
#     print(x)


# 2. Write a program to sum all the elements from list.
# list = eval(input("Enter List:"))
# sum=0
# for x in list:
#     sum=sum + x;
# print("The Sum=",sum)

# To print numbers from 1 to 10 by using while loop
# x = 1
# while x <= 10:
#     print(x)
#     x = x+1


# Infinite Loop.
# i=0
# while True:
#     i=i+1
#     print("Hello", i)


# Nested Loop.
# for i in range(4):
#     for j in range(4):
#         print("i=",i," j=",j)
